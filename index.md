## About Me

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Rohan Gumaste, an incoming [EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) PhD student at MIT [CSAIL](https://csail.mit.edu), where I intend to work with Professor [Michael Carbin](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/).

Recently I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I earned a B.S. in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/).  

During my undergrad, I worked at the FOCAL Lab with Professor [Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/) on offline RL, PBRL and adversarial traning for RLHF, as well as applications in AI safety. I was also a part of the ARC lab where I worked with Professor [Sasa Misailovic](https://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/). Here, I researched program synthesis and code generation. Specifically we focused on constrained LLM decoding, with an emphasis on iterative grammar aligned methods. In an earlier project, I briefly worked on translating natural language to formal logic programs. 

Earlier I finished a year long remote research experience at Sandia National Laboratories where I worked with [Dr. Daniel Ries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ries-48589225) on statistical modeling for near real-time lightning strike prediction. We studied spatiotemporal modeling, probabalistic programming, bayesian methods, and optimization. 

Previously, I worked at the Crowd Dynamics Laboratory under the supervision of Professor [Hari Sundaram](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/). We researched deep neural recommender systems, with a focus on fast machine unlearning, differential privacy, and the cold start problem.
