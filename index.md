## About Me

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Rohan Gumaste, an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a B.S. in Statistics and Computer Science.  

Currently, I'm working at the FOCAL Lab  with Professor [Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/) on offline RL, PBRL and adversarial traning for RLHF, as well as applications in AI safety. I'm also a part of the ARC lab where I work with Professor [Sasa Misailovic](https://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/). Here, I'm researching program synthesis and code generation. Specifically I've been working on constrained LLM decoding, with a focus on iterative grammar aligned methods. In an earlier project, I briefly worked on translating natural language to formal logic programs. 

Recently, I finished a year long remote research experience at Sandia National Laboratories where I worked with [Dr. Daniel Ries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ries-48589225) on statistical modeling for near real-time lightning strike prediction. We studied spatiotemporal modeling, probabalistic programming, bayesian methods, and optimization. 

Previously, I worked at the Crowd Dynamics Laboratory under the supervision of Professor [Hari Sundaram](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/). We researched deep neural recommender systems, with a particular emphasis on fast machine unlearning, differential privacy, and the cold start problem.
